# Web11

**:construction: This project is a work in progress :construction:**

 A faithful Windows 11 shell recreation for the web with an emphasis on emulating the Windows 11 "Fluent" UI as accurately as possible. Created from scratch with HTML/CSS/JS.

 This is accomplished by studying the [Windows 11 design documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/signature-experiences/design-principles), eyeballing the user interface to recreate specific elements in CSS and using tools to identify the usage of specific colours across Windows where possible.

 Currently only the desktop context menu, start menu and taskbar have been partially implemented.

## :link: Dependencies

- **jQuery** *( CDN link referenced in index.html )*
  - This will likely be removed at some point since it's only being used for basic DOM manipulation

- [**Microsoft Fluent System Icons**](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-system-icons) *( included in /fonts )*
  - Webfont used for most shell icons

## :bangbang: Known Issues

- The context menu border does not display correctly over the top of other elements
- Several microinteractions have not yet been implemented on the start menu
- Context menu icons are not using a duotone colour scheme yet
